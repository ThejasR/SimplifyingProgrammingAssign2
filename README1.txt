Question Title - You are given a .csv file which has been written in the following format COUNTRY,CAPITAL,POPULATION
Write a program which reads data from the .csv file and populates it into a .txt file in the form of sentences like:
The capital of <COUNTRY> is <CAPITAL> with a population of <POPULATION>.
Source Code Files-
asn2.py - This file contains the program written to execute the problem statement
Country.csv - This file consists of a collection of three columns (country,capital and population) of various countries

Copy both these files to the same directory and in command line cd to that folder
type in python3 asn2.py -f <file_name> -l <logfile_name>

Bugs - It doesnt handle cases where in you compile the program without command line arguments
